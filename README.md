# Twitter Word Cloud
Personal project to display word clouds of public twitter profiles with Python GUI. Calibrated for personal use to entertain my friends. 

To run this project, many python libraries would have to be installed, and Twitter API keys would be needed (since I won't publicly share mine). So please just treat this as an online demo until I have time to create a requirements doc. If you want me to create a wordcloud for any particular public users feel free to message me :)

# Demo
The application takes a twitter username and creates a simple word cloud. The word cloud is calibrated to exclude stop words and most common curse words, and only counts nouns, as these calibrations have returned best results. NLTK is used for some of the natural language processing. Links, emojis and more are also excluded. 

Below is a screenshot of the application after analysing the tweets of President Biden of USA at https://twitter.com/POTUS
